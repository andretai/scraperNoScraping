                    <title>Introduction to Apache Spark</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs105x</link>
                    <description>Spark is rapidly becoming the compute engine of choice for big data. Spark programs are more concise and often run 10-100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce jobs. As companies realize this, Spark developers are becoming increasingly valued.

This statistics and data analysis course will teach you the basics of working with Spark and will provide you with the necessary foundation for diving deeper into Spark. You’ll learn about Spark’s architecture and programming model, including commonly used APIs. After completing this course, you’ll be able to write and debug basic Spark applications. This course will also explain how to use Spark’s web user interface (UI), how to recognize common coding errors, and how to proactively prevent errors. The focus of this course will be Spark Core and Spark SQL.

This course covers advanced undergraduate-level material. It requires a programming background and experience with Python (or the ability to learn it quickly). All exercises will use PySpark (the Python API for Spark), but previous experience with Spark or distributed computing is NOT required. Students should take this Python mini-quiz before the course and take this Python mini-course if they need to learn Python or refresh their Python knowledge.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/hollywood-history-industry-art-pennx-hollywoodx</link>
                    <description>In this course you will learn about Hollywood and how it came to be the global powerhouse of today.

We will discuss the complex Hollywood industry and how business and politics translate into the art of film, TV, and new media.

This course will chronicle Hollywood’s growth and global reach since the 1920s, looking at:


	How Hollywood has responded to new  technologies such as synchronized sound, color cinematography, TV, home video, computer graphics, and the internet
	How the global spread of Hollywood since the 1920s changed  the film industry
	The relationship between Hollywood and independent  film
	Hollywood’s responses to crises in American  politics (e.g., world wars, the cold war, the 1960s counterculture, 9/11)


We will look closely at representative studios  (Paramount, Disney, Fox, and others) and representative filmmakers (Mary  Pickford, Charles Chaplin, Frank Capra, George Lucas, Spike Lee, among many others).</description>

                    <title>World of Wine: From Grape to Glass</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/world-wine-grape-glass-adelaidex-wine101x-2</link>
                    <description>Think about your favourite wine. Imagine the brilliance of its colour in the glass, the ripe fruit aromas on the nose, a hint of toasty oak and lingering tannins on the back palate. Perhaps you like a specific wine, but can’t pinpoint the reason why. The attributes that make wine so enjoyable are achieved through the expertise of viticulturists and winemakers, whose decision-making in the vineyard and winery is underpinned by science – to be precise, viticulture and oenology.

The finer details can take years to learn, but in a matter of weeks this course will give you a broad understanding of the principles and practices used to grow grapes and make wine, and their impact on wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste. You’ll also gain an appreciation for how cutting-edge research is helping to secure the future sustainability of the global wine industry. Whether you’re a wine novice or a seasoned oenophile,, this course is for anyone who loves wine and wine tasting. You’ll even get to make your own wine-- virtually at least!

Confidently describe wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste.</description>

                    <title>University Studies for Student Veterans</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/university-studies-student-veterans-columbiax-ussv101x</link>
                    <description>The skills you learned in the military will go a long way toward helping you succeed in college, but if you’re looking for some extra support – or an academic tune-up – then you’ll find it in this course. We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.
This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.
While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you’re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you’ll join us.
This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an “orientation” for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.
We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.</description>

                    <description>Many Americans complain that they do not understand the U.S. health reform law called the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare). They are right, and the main reason is because most Americans do not understand the basics of the U.S. health care system and U.S. health policy. Featuring some of the nation’s foremost teachers and thought leaders, this course provides students with a basic and thorough understanding of the U.S. health care system focusing on access, quality of care, and costs. Students will learn how the system is structured, how care is organized, delivered, and financed, and how the Affordable Care Act will influence the future of the system. Students will understand the U.S. health policy making structure process at the federal, state, and local levels. Students who complete this course will be able to interpret current controversies around US health policy and develop informed opinions on future policy developments.

                    <description>Today, you are the law.

What does it mean to be a citizen? It means to participate in your society, to connect with others, and to decide, with them, the issues that you face.

It starts with you.

We need to learn to talk civilly with each other about the issues of consequence, but are we capable of learning how to speak together, listen together, and decide together?

In JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change, an experiment in online civic discourse, you are invited to engage with Professor Nesson and others with an understanding that each of us starts from a place of anonymity. Through a series of asynchronous and synchronous online group activities, you will explore a deliberative system by which emotionally charged issues can be discussed.

Although you will learn a bit about the history of jury and even serve as a member of a virtual jury for a mock criminal case, this experiment is about active participation in the deliberative process and how you might use that framework to facilitate dialogue within your own affinity group or community.

The program consists of six modules. Each week, you will learn and apply a new step in a system designed to foster meaningful dialogue. Starting with an introduction to the course’s deliberative framework, you will move from a traditional jury-based application to a live social issue unfolding in real time: the Massachusetts referendum for the “Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana.” As citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts deliberate on this issue, so will you and your JuryX peers. What arguments will shape this debate, and what will the final outcome be?

Can we, civilly, discuss an issue like marijuana regulation?

Two synchronous small-group online deliberations will be held using Google Hangout. Participation is optional, but highly recommended.

JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is, ultimately, about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication. By listening, speaking, persuading, and being persuaded, you will learn about yourself and others.

If you have faith, faith will be given to you.

                    <description>Problems with healthcare quality, access, and costs bedevil all countries. This course explores how to create successful global business innovations in health care that can better meet consumer and social needs. Upon conclusion, you will learn to evaluate opportunities and gain an understanding of the elements necessary for viable healthcare business models.
 
Innovating in Health Care (IHC) enables participants to meet and interact with others who are also interested in improving health care. Through case study analysis and application of the “Innovating in Health Care Framework”, this course focuses on evaluating and crafting healthcare startup business models that focus on the six factors that critically shape new healthcare ventures: Financing, Structure, Public Policy, Consumers, Technology, and Accountability. Innovating in Health Care discusses the impact of these factors on business models for three different kinds of innovations: Consumer-focused, technology-driven, and integrations which create scale.
 Innovating in Health Care is being offered in 2 formats:

                    <description>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the major social variables—social class, race, gender, poverty, income distribution, social networks/support, community cohesion, the work and neighborhood environment—that affect population health.

The course covers the theoretical underpinnings of each construct (e.g. "race" as a social category), and surveys the empirical research linking each to population health status. Methods are introduced to operationalize each construct for the purposes of empirical application in epidemiologic research.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-apr-computer-science-principles-harvardx-cs50-ap</link>
                    <description>This is CS50 AP, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework. 

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 AP teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50 AP, CS50 itself, is Harvard's largest course.

Students in high school may receive AP credit for this course provided their school approves the credit and administers the College Board's end-of-year exam. Students who earn a satisfactory score (70% or higher) on each of the course's assigned problems are also eligible to receive a verified certificate from HarvardX.</description>

                    <title>PredictionX: John Snow and the Cholera Epidemic of 1854</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/predictionx-john-snow-cholera-epidemic-harvardx-soc1-jsx</link>
                    <description>In 1854, a cholera epidemic swept through the London neighborhood of Soho. In the course of about three weeks, over 600 people died. This incident was, tragically, not unusual in London or the rest of the 19th century world as a whole. The scourge of cholera seemed unstoppable and, even worse, unpredictable. But one doctor -- ignored by the scientific community at large -- set out to prove that he knew how cholera was spread.

Join us for this one-week, immersive learning experience. We will explore John Snow’s London, from the streets of Soho to the dataset that helped create the map that changed our understanding of cholera and epidemiology forever.

This course features interactive tools including an interactive ArcGIS map of the 1854 cholera outbreak and a Timeline JS of John Snow’s investigation. 

This module is a part of PredictionX, which looks at the history of attempts to predict the future. PredictionX courses will cover topics from omens and oracles in ancient civilizations to modern computer simulations.</description>

                    <title>Psychology of Political Activism: Women Changing the World</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/psychology-political-activism-women-smithx-psy374x-1</link>
                    <description>Have you ever wanted to change the world? Have you ever wondered what motivates some people to become activists? What experiences in your childhood or when you were a teenager may have shaped your political identity? Join us, along with Gloria Steinem, Loretta Ross, and others, in a seven-week exploration of these questions and more. In this course, you will analyze some of the psychological theories that help explain what leads people to want to change society.

Through rich, interactive case studies you will meet nine prominent women activists who were engaged in efforts and movements in the U.S. from the 1960s through the 1990s including the Civil Rights Movement, the LGBTQ Movement, and the Reproductive Justice Movement. Within our online community you will discuss and debate how psychological theories can explain these activists’ motivations, discover where the theories are and are not applicable, and collaboratively create new understandings and analyses.

Each week, Gloria Steinem (SC ‘56) will provide her thoughts and insight into how these theories might apply to contemporary issues.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/quality-of-life-livability-in-future-cities-3</link>
                    <description>Cities are becoming the predominant living and working environment of humanity, and for this reason, livability or quality of life in the city has become crucial.

This urban planning course will focus on four areas that directly affect livability in a city: Urban energy, urban climate, urban ecology and urban mobility. The course begins by presenting measurable criteria for the assessment of livability, and how to positively influence the design of cities towards greater livability. We will focus on this basic topic of the human habitat in a holistic way, and introduce possibilities of participatory urban design by citizens, leading towards the development of a citizen design science.

You will be able to share your experiences with the other participants in the course and also with the experts from the teaching team. In completing this course, you will better understand how to make a city more livable by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different properties and impact factors of the urban system.

Livability in Future Cities is the second course in a series of MOOCs under the title “Future Cities.” This series aims to bring the latest research on planning, managing and transforming cities to places where this knowledge has the highest benefit for its citizens. “Future Cities” provided an overview, and this course will focus on livability in existing and new cities. </description>

                    <description>Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.

The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. “Future Cities” will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.</description>

                    <title>Introduction to Environmental Science</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-environmental-science-dartmouthx-dart-envs-02x</link>
                    <description>Introduction to Environmental Science, ENVX, was first offered in early 2015.

Environmental science is the study of patterns and processes in the natural world and their modification by human activity.  To understand current environmental problems, we need to consider physical, biological and chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems. This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems.  This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet.

Environmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine:

The field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist
	The human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment
	Agriculture, soils and the environmental implications of eating meat, vegetables, local, organic, sustainable, industrial and other types of food
	Non-renewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal, petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each
	Renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable “green” energy sources have impacts as well as benefits
	Biodiversity and global change, which are the integrating units of environmental science
Education method
The course will utilize video lectures, interviews with experts, readings, discussions, multiple choice and prompted discussions and one graded quiz per week. There will also be several optional live office hours on Google Hangouts.

Completion of self-assessments, contributions to discussion and quiz scores will determine the final grade. </description>

                    <description>How can we strengthen sustainability? By empowering individuals and communities to transform and balance dynamic natural resources, economic prosperity, and healthy populations.

In this course, you’ll explore productive and disruptive social, ecological, and economic intersections – the “triple bottom line.” You’ll investigate a spectrum of global, national, regional, municipal and personal relationships that are increasing resiliency. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to effectively locate your interests, and to leverage optimistic change within emerging 21st century urban environments.

This course will describe fundamental paradigm shifts that are shaping sustainability. These include connectivity, diversity, citizen engagement, collaboration source tracing, mapping, transportation, and integrative, regenerative design. We will take examples from cities around the globe; making particular use of the complex evolution of site-specific conditions within the Connecticut River watershed. In addition we will present tools and strategies that can be utilized by individuals, communities, and corporations to orchestrate effective and collective change.

Each week, lessons will highlight the significance of clean water as a key indication of ecosystem, community and human health. Learners will be asked to investigate and share information about their local environment.

Finally, we will note the impact of such disruptive forces as industrial pollution, changing governance, privatization of public services, mining of natural resources, public awareness, and climate change. A fundamental course goal will be to characterize indicators of economic prosperity and happiness that relate to environmental sustainability – and the capacity of individuals to create change.</description>

                    <title>The Biology of Water and Health - Sustainable Interventions</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/biology-water-health-sustainable-oecx-ph242x</link>
                    <description>This water sustainability course (PH242x) from Tufts University focuses on the engineering and public health components needed to achieve the conservation of safe water locally and globally. Together, we will explore how to create sustainable interventions geared towards improving population health.

This course provides an interdisciplinary framework for understanding the place of water in health policy and engineering by delving into the complex social, economic, political and scientific factors that influence how we approach these critical health and water related challenges. 

We identify threats to our water supply, including climate change, urbanization, agriculture and emerging contaminants. We lead a water sampling field trip and analyze the results in order to understand how water quality is assessed and regulated. We learn how to conduct a “Risk Assessment” as it relates to human and environmental health. The class will debate about issues such as water privatization, social and environmental justice and hydrofracturing. We’ll learn about point of use interventions for local interventions and take a field trip to the massive Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to see firsthand how large scale interventions are built and managed. Lastly, we will learn about various anthological determinants that drive the sustainability of interventions, review strategies for water management in developing and developed countries, and discuss the opportunities and challenges with implementing these solutions.

In addition to lectures hosted by Tufts Professors Dr. David M. Gute and Dr. Jeffrey K. Griffiths, the course features field trips, and guest lecturers comprised of renowned water professionals, entrepreneurs and scientists from the fields of public health, engineering, environmental science and health policy.

We hope that your ability to conceptualize and address water-related issues will advance as a result of the lecture content, in class demonstrations and global dialogues. To achieve this goal, we strongly encourage active participation and discussion with the professors, students and water professionals from across the globe. 

Lastly, check out the content from The Biology of Water and Health – Fundamentals (PH241x), an archived course that provides a provocative introduction to topics such as the vital role of sanitation and hygiene, waterborne diseases, environmental epidemiology, and water contaminants.

Tufts University is proud to offer the two Biology of Water and Health courses (PH241x &amp; PH242x) in partnership with the Open Education Consortium (OECx). All course content is openly licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license.</description>

                    <description>Digital systems are at the heart of the information age in which we live, allowing us to store, communicate and manipulate information quickly and reliably. This computer science course is a bottom-up exploration of the abstractions, principles, and techniques used in the design of digital and computer systems. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of electricity and some exposure to programming, roll up your sleeves, join in and design a computer system!

This is Part 2 of a 3-part series on digital systems, teaching the fundamentals of computer architecture and is based on a course offered by the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Topics include instruction set architectures and assembly language, stacks and procedures, 32-bit computer architecture, the memory hierarchy, and caches.

Using your browser for design entry and simulation, you’ll implement a 32-bit computer using our gate library and write assembly language programs to explore the hardware/software interface.

 

Learner Testimonial

“If you look back, we've done sooooo much: assembly programming, stack crawling (detective work), building a 32-bit computer, for crying out loud, and also learnt about caches as the cherry on top (which really helped me because I always had trouble understanding how temporary memory worked). And to top it off, they're promising us more exciting courses in the future.” -- Previous Student</description>

Learner Testimonial

“This course is like a dream coming true...as kid (10 - 12 years) I was already building circuits and reading books about Digital Circuits. Due to all kind of circumstances I never got to pursue a study and career in electronics ...now I am almost 50... I see this as a second chance. Thank you very very much for this awesome course. One of the best, (if not the best) MOOCs I've ever taken.” -- Previous Student</description>

Addressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.

The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. 该课程是“北大-德稻网络开放课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。

教师课堂面授的作用？
为服务可以出席面授的学生，本课程将在在线学习之外，安排固定时间固定长度的教师课程面授，教学活动将被录制，在线发布，以保证在线学习学生的需求。

Will I fail to keep up in the course due to my lack of understanding about the field of music?

Our content is adjusted to a general audience. 

课程是否会因在音乐领域积累不足而无法跟进？
教师依照课程核心，一方面给出清晰课程线索，跟进不难，另一方面，教师尽可能调整课程内容，照顾到全体情况。根据以往的经验，课程结束，同学均可跟进课程标准，且不乏各样收获。

Are there content knowledge pre-requisites for this course?

An earnest desire to learn and a proactive, professional attitude are more important than prior knowledge of content matter. The learners are expected to absorb the basic content points quickly and use them as a base for further learning.

课程内容秉持怎样的上课标准？教师保持一贯上课理念，认为专业，关于态度，不关乎知识，不会因同学不同程度，顾左右言其他，忽略最核心最关键知识点及问题的涉及。

Which is more important for this course, knowledge or ability?

This course is most concerned on the development of music listening ability, though some knowledge of music will be helpful. 

课程重视知识还是能力？
课 程最关心音乐聆听能力的发展，在提供行之有效聆听技术的同时，安排适当知识内容的传授。加之考试不重知识，而重能力，因此，课程中因教室光线不足而造成无 法做太多笔记，恰恰是教师所希望的。课后传发同学的曲目说明，其中所标出的知识点，所指系能力而非知识。在音乐领域，所谓历史是听觉样本，即艺术品本身积 累起来的，而非人名和作品名串联起来的。艺术史，是感觉的历史，不是文字描述的历史。

What is the aim of the music puzzle assignment within the course?

The purpose of the assignment is to prepare and develop audiometry and memory skills.

课程所谓音乐拼图作业的目的是什么？
作 业的目的，在于听觉甄别力和记忆力的筹备与发展。相当于我们小时候玩得拼图或积木游戏，从局部观察到整体把握，这一训练所形成的对线条、形状、色泽等构成 物的甄别与记忆，不仅是视觉所需，也是发达听觉所必备。多数情况下，类似课程作业的练习，在中国音乐课程中，很少会有。之所以课程一开始便这样做，是因为 知道学生听觉的普遍问题。不少同学在实践之初，会遇到困难，这很正常，如果没有做好接受困难的准备，也就不必来此课程分享，也就不必来北大读书了。

Will the course provide information about music composition and technology?

No. Music composition mastery requires long-term training, usually at a conservatory level.

课程是否可能或可以提供关于作曲的知识与技术？
课 程不可能在作曲方面给予单独帮助，通过目前的教学方式，尽管正在探索，教师只能也必须照顾到最大多数同学的需求，这一难处，是客观的，请多谅解。关于作曲 四大件的技术发展，在音乐学院有一套完整的训练程序，乐理是入门，和声是基础，二者建立关于调性音乐系统的初阶。随后的复调写作，作曲系耗时约需一年甚至 更多，根据全面仿作练习，帮助同学发展多声思维和多声部操控技术。配器是第三梯度，约需一年时间完成，全面掌握乐队法。曲式分析，是封顶收官之课。将之前 所有梯队课程的内容，一并总结。

Will the course be available in English?

The videos in the course will include English subtitles. However, the rest of the course content will only be available in Mandarin.

这门课程使用英语授课吗？
视频中教师使用中文授课，有英文字幕，但是课程的其他内容，如阅读、作业题、讨论等都只用中文。</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/plasma-physics-applications-epflx-plasmaapplicationx-0</link>
                    <description>This physics course, taught by world-renowned experts in the field, will provide you with an overview of applications in plasma physics. From the study of far distant astrophysical objects, over diverse applications in industry and medicine, to the ultimate goal of sustainable electricity generation from nuclear fusion.
In the first part of this course, you will learn how nuclear fusion powers our Sun and the stars in the Universe. You will explore the cyclic variation of the Sun’s activity, how plasma flows can generate large-scale magnetic fields, and how these fields can reconnect to release large amounts of energy, manifested, for instance, by violent eruptions on the Sun.
The second part of this course discusses the key role of plasma applications in industry and introduces the emerging field of plasma medicine. You will learn in detail how plasmas are generated and sustained in strong electric fields, why plasmas are indispensable for the manufacturing of today’s integrated circuits, and what the prospects are of plasma treatments in cancerology, dentistry and dermatology.
In the third and most extensive part of this course, you will familiarize yourself with the different approaches to fusion energy, the current status, and the necessary steps from present-day experimental devices towards a fusion reactor providing electricity to the grid. You will learn about the key ingredients of a magnetic fusion reactor, how to confine, heat, and control fusion plasmas at temperatures of 100 million degrees Kelvin, explore the challenges of plasma wall interactions and structural materials, and the importance of superconductivity.
Finally, in the fourth part of this course, you will learn about laser-created plasmas and the interaction between plasmas and high-power laser pulses. Applications range from energy production by thermonuclear fusion to laboratory astrophysics, creation of intense sources of high-energy particle and radiation beams, and fundamental studies involving high-field quantum electrodynamics.
To enjoy this course on plasma applications, it is recommended to first familiarize yourself with the plasma physics basics taught in Plasma Physics: Introduction.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/electricity-magnetism-part-1-ricex-phys102-1x-1</link>
                    <description>PHYS 102.1x serves as an introduction to electricity and magnetism, following the standard second semester college physics sequence. Part 1 begins with electric charge in matter, the forces between charges, the electric field, Gauss’s Law, and the electric potential. Electric current and resistance are introduced, and then DC circuits are described, including time-dependent behavior with resistors and capacitors. PHYS 102.1x consists of 5 weekly learning sequences, each with ~1.5 hours of video lectures, conceptual lecture problems, and online homework questions. The course concludes with an online exam during the 6th week.  

What are the prerequisites?
We will assume that you are familiar with vectors, that you know how to calculate integrals, and that you have had introductory mechanics. These topics will be briefly reviewed as needed, but not in a systematic way. If you have not had classes in these topics it may be possible to complete the course with extra study.

What textbook is required?
The course will not strictly follow or make assignments from a specific textbook.  Any recent freshman physics textbook will suffice. Reading assignments will be given by topic, including links to several free online physics textbooks.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/science-politics-gmo-cornellx-gmo101x</link>
                    <description>What exactly are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and why do scientists develop them? Studying the science of GMOs helps us understand biotechnology’s potential role in addressing challenges in agriculture.

In this introductory Food and Nutrition course, you will learn the basics of genetic engineering, explore the political debate around the GMO and review the arguments for and against their use.

We will study the politics surrounding the GMO and its impact at both an individual level and to society as a whole; including the problems, perceptions, benefits, and risks associated with GMOs. Important to understanding the complexities around this topic we will not only be looking at the science behind how the GMO works, but also to the limitations of this science. We will also discuss the importance of information literacy as a tool for effectively identifying and evaluating issues.

Our goal is that this MOOC will impact people's understanding of science, what it can and can't do, and how information is transmitted. The intent is not to influence how people feel about GMOs, but to give them the critical thinking and scientific literacy tools necessary to make informed decisions — and to understand the broader impacts of those decisions.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/sustainability-science-key-concept-utokyox-utokyo006x-0</link>
                    <description>Sustainability is indispensable for the future of humankind. Sustainability science has emerged as an effort to tackle the complex problems the world is facing today. Lecturers from different disciplines provide a holistic overview of key issues in sustainability including industrial pollution, an aging society, human-nature connection, urban planning, resilience, environmental governance, and education for sustainable development. 

In this course, you will learn about historical and current sustainability issues that have emerged around the world, as well as some of the approaches that have been used to solve them. You will be exposed to industrial and water pollution control issues, in addition to challenges caused by an aging and shrinking population.

You will also learn about the human-nature connection and initiatives that aim to create sustainable societies in harmony with nature, based on the concept of Socio-Ecological Production Landscapes and Seascapes (SEPLS). You will explore how ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) approaches can be used to reestablish the human-nature connection through re-naturalization of damaged environments.

This course will also consider an urban planning point of view by exploring the value of an urban-rural land use mixture to create new sustainable societies and resilient megacities.

Finally, you will learn about environmental governance, a crucial element for progress towards a sustainable future. You will be introduced to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a learning method for sustainable development and discuss international debates on ESD.

Japanese perspectives are emphasized throughout the course in the hopes of providing concrete value to solving contemporary sustainability issues.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/corporate-social-responsibility-csr-pennx-sp2pennx</link>
                    <description>Developed by Penn and the Satell Institute, this course provides theory and practical working concepts in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), exploring cases that demonstrate the great potential CSR may have to improve communities in the world, and to create awareness of potential pitfalls.

Students will learn (a) how to leverage corporate structures and nonprofits’ experience to undertake CSR activities that have real public benefit, (b) the relationship between philanthropy and corporate self-interest, and (c) how ventures can assess whether they are doing good CSR, exploring topics including measurement, attribution, and cost benefit analysis.
Through this four-week course, students from either the business or the philanthropic sector will develop a greater understanding of both sides of the partnerships that underlie Corporate Social Responsibility projects. They will learn how they might improve their interactions with their cross-sector partners, develop better partnerships, improve their use of pooled resources, and deepen their impact.
Finally, they will learn from many examples of Corporate Social Responsibility across the world. This course will teach students interested in developing a CSR project to conduct a wider search than they may have previously undertaken to identify lessons and solutions that they may adapt to their own setting.

                    <description>If you look at two genes that serve the same purpose in two different species, how can you rigorously compare these genes in order to see how they have evolved away from each other?

In the first part of the course, part of the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMasters program, we will see how the dynamic programming paradigm can be used to solve a variety of different questions related to pairwise and multiple string comparison in order to discover evolutionary histories.

In the second part of the course, we will see how a powerful machine learning approach, using a Hidden Markov Model, can dig deeper and find relationships between less obviously related sequences, such as areas of the rapidly mutating HIV genome.</description>

                    <description>Knowing the geometrical structure of the molecules around us is one of the most important and fundamental issues in the field of chemistry. This course introduces the two primary methods used to determine the geometrical structure of molecules: molecular spectroscopy and gas electron diffraction.

In molecular spectroscopy, molecules are irradiated with light or electric waves to reveal rich information, including:

Motions of electrons within a molecule (Week 1),
	Vibrational motions of the nuclei within a molecule (Week 2), and
	Rotational motions of a molecule (Week 3).
In the gas electron diffraction method, molecules are irradiated with an accelerated electron beam. As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules.

By the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.

                    <description>Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to all students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and students who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics.

Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution.

NOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy”

We have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems.  This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism.

If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up in the special teacher section featuring a discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course.  To join these discussions,  verify yourself as a teacher, and we will sign you up in the teacher forum.

Note that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers, so please do not register if you are not a teacher.

Teachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate.

Course Syllabus

Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials

The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group, dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online.  We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught on-campus course  - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning.   (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC).  This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that  will be administerered to randomly assigned sub-groups of our students.  At certain points in the course, new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups.  We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities.

Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects.  As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:

We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). 
	The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials.
Note: By clicking on the registration button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above. 

Welcome, and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course.

FAQs

Is there a required textbook?

You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday and Resnick, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).

 

What if I take a vacation?

The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course contents are released four weeks ahead of the deadline, so even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.

 

Will I get a certficiate?

Yes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.

 

How are grades assigned?

There are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem.

The course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.

There is no final exam.</description>

                    <title>Advanced Introductory Classical Mechanics</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-introductory-classical-mitx-8-mechcx-0</link>
                    <description>This college-level, calculus-based Introductory Newtonian Mechanics course covers all of the topics and learning objectives specified in the College Board Course Description for Advanced Placement®Physics C (Mechanics). It covers Newton’s Laws, Kinematics, Energy, Momentum, Rigid Body Rotation, and Angular Momentum. The course covers applications of these basic principles to simple harmonic motion, orbital motion, and to problems that involve more than one basic principle. These principles also underlie the 12 online laboratory activities.

Our emphasis is on helping students learn expert-like ways of solving challenging problems, many of which are similar to problems on previous Advanced Placement Examinations in Mechanics C. We stress a key insight: mechanics is about forces changing motion. We apply this concept to organizing the core knowledge in a way that helps students apply it to sophisticated multi-concept problems. We feel this is the best way to prepare students for success not only on the AP Examination but also in other college-level science, technology, engineering and math courses that emphasize problem-solving.

If you are a teacher looking to learn better ways to teach your students, or are interested in using some of our MOOC materials in your own classroom—possibly as a private online course for your students—we strongly encourage you to sign up for our teacher’s discussion cohort, a “private discussion room” for teachers to share pedagogical ideas and instructional techniques.To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher by clicking this link, and we will enroll you in the teacher’s discussion cohort.

FAQ

How long is this course?

The course consists of 13 weeks of required (graded) material and 2 weeks of optional (ungraded) material. You do not need to complete the optional weeks in order to receive a certificate, but we strongly encourage you to complete these units, especially if you are preparing for the College Board’s AP Physics C: Mechanics exam.

Is there a required textbook?

You do not need to buy a textbook. A complete eText, including worked-examples and some video lectures, is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday, Resnick, &amp; Walker, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).

My physics is a little rusty. How should I prepare for this course?

If you would like to brush-up on basic mechanics skills before taking this course, we recommend the brief warm-up course, On-Ramp to AP Physics C: Mechanics. 

What if I take a vacation?

The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course content is always released at least 3 weeks ahead of the deadline, providing you with the opportunity for flexibility in scheduling.

How are grades assigned?

There are five parts of the course that are worth points: (1) Checkpoint problems are incorporated into the reading; (2) most weeks have an interactive lab component; (3) more involved homework problems occur at the end of each week and (4) quizzes at the end of every 1-2 weeks; (5) the course culminates in a final exam. Each category is worth a varying number of points; and you are allowed several attempts on each problem. A final grade of at least 60% is needed for certification; hence you will not have to do every problem.

Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials

The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is a physics education research group. We are dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online. In one of the only published studies measuring learning in a massive open online course (MOOC), we showed that a previous iteration of this course produced slightly more conceptual learning than a traditionally taught on-campus course. Currently, we are working to find just what caused this learning.  

In this course, the RELATE group will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that will be administered to randomly assigned sub-groups of course participants. At certain points in the course, new vs. more traditional sequences of activities will be assigned to different sub-groups. We will then use common questions to compare the amount of associated learning. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that all groups will have some new activities and some traditional ones.

Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects. As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:

We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). 
	The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has slightly harder materials.
Note: By clicking on the “Enroll Now” button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the sub-groups described above.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-project-management-adelaidex-project101x-1</link>
                    <description>Project management is an essential skill-set for many careers and in many contexts in our lives. Introduction to Project Management is an ideal starting point if you need to manage projects at work or at home, while not necessarily being a formally trained project manager. It is also suitable if you are considering undertaking a project in the near future and are seeking to learn and apply essential project management knowledge and skills.

To deliver a project successfully, it’s important to start by clearly identifying what the project is, and what its outcomes will be. In the course, we will show you practical ways to explore and understand your goals from the outset of your project, and to consider all the factors that may affect its execution. Step by step you will learn how to plan, scope, schedule, cost and manage your project from beginning to end. Since every project relies on the people who are delivering it, the course also enables you to explore how you can effectively communicate, manage people and employ leadership skills to successfully deliver your own project.

In Introduction to Project Management, you will learn practical ways to use project management skills, whether your project is large or small. Join us to explore how you can benefit from using project management techniques in your own projects.</description>

                    <description>In this engineering course, we will cover all aspects of communication acoustics, which is the way sounds travels from a source, through a channel and finally to a receiver. We will look at the different system components involved in acoustic communication, including those between humans, between humans and machines, and between machines. This includes:

speech acoustics
	hearing acoustics
	electroacoustics
	spatial sound capture and presentation
	simulation of acoustical environments
	the human auditory system
	digital audio processing methods
You will learn from top experts in the field of communication acoustics, who are all affiliated with TU9, the nine leading Universities of Technology in Germany.

                    <description>Louis Armstrong. Charlie Parker. John Coltrane. You’ve heard their names, but do you know what makes them great? In Jazz Appreciation, you will learn what these artists and many others contributed to America’s great original art form, revered the world over for its innovation and creativity. Jazz emerged during a time of tremendous change and upheaval in American society; this course will also discuss how its evolution both reflected and contributed to those changes.

Much more than a lecture series, Jazz Appreciation weaves in musical performances and examples that will deepen your understanding of the musical process and develop your ability to identify and analyze different jazz eras and great jazz soloists. It also incorporates cutting-edge adaptive learning technology that will allow you to practice your new knowledge and skills, at your own pace, until you reach mastery.

Join this course to enhance your enjoyment of jazz by developing an informed understanding and deep appreciation of the art.

Please note: This course includes a wealth of music. In sensitivity to artists’ rights, course videos including music are available for a limited time only. Materials are released weekly on Saturday mornings, and videos are removed nine days later, on Sunday nights. Please plan to keep pace with the course in order to get the most out of it.

                    <description>“If history is our guide, we can assume that the battle between the intellect and will of the human species and the extraordinary adaptability of microbes will be never-ending.” (1)

Despite all the remarkable technological breakthroughs that we have made over the past few decades, the threat from infectious diseases has significantly accelerated. In this course, we will learn why this is the case by looking at the fundamental scientific principles underlying epidemics and the public health actions behind their prevention and control in the 21st century.

This course covers these four topics:


	origins of novel pathogens;
	analysis of the spread of infectious diseases;
	medical and public health countermeasures to prevent and control epidemics;
	panel discussions involving leading public health experts with deep frontline experiences to share their views on risk communication, crisis management, ethics and public trust in the context of infectious disease control.&amp;nbsp;

如果历史是我们的向导，我们可以认为人类的智慧和意志与微生物种惊人的适应性之间的斗争将永远持续下去。”(1)

尽管过去的几十年间我们在科技领域取得了令人瞩目的突破，可是传染病对人类的威胁却显著增加。本课程将通过学习流行病学的基础科学原理以及预防与控制流行病的公共卫生措施，对上述现象予以阐释。

课程包括下列四个主题：
•	新型病原体如何产生
•	分析传染病的传播方式
•	预防和控制流行病的医学与公共卫生措施
•	专题讨论：具有丰富一线经验的公共卫生专家将针对控制传染病的风险沟通、危机管理、伦理学、公众信任等方面的问题予以讨论。

                    <description>Actuary is rated the best job of 2015 by CareerCast.com because it pays well and offers abundant opportunities for advancement. 

You may have heard of actuarial science, or you might even know an actuary, but do you know what an actuary does? During the course you’ll hear from a wide variety of actuaries about their careers.

And don’t be scared that the course will be “just a whole lot of mathematics”. Together, we will go beyond the math to learn how actuaries approach problems relating to risk, using examples from:

Finance
	Investments
	Banking
	Insurance
You will learn how actuarial science applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in these industries and other professions.

You’ll experience “hands-on” learning using Excel (or an equivalent spreadsheet tool) to project and investigate the financial condition of a company choosing appropriate strategies for the company through the use of simulations.

The course has been carefully designed for students from a wide variety of backgrounds, with secondary/high school level being the only assumption of mathematical background. Even if you don’t have any background in, for example, calculus, the course has been designed so you can skip over these sections without affecting your understanding of the rest of the course. You also do not need to have any Excel or other spreadsheet background to take the course.

For those with stronger mathematical backgrounds, extension questions are provided to test you further. You’ll learn a huge amount about actuarial science no matter what your background is!

"Great introduction to this specialized field; every day there are new challenges where as a student you are put in a situation to learn and apply the lessons with practical exercises. Great structure of the course, with main concepts to review at the end of a lesson. I would recommend to anyone who would like to learn more about actuarial science." - Previous student</description>

                    <title>The Immune System: New Developments in Research - Part 1</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/immune-system-new-developments-research-osakaux-bio101x-0</link>
                    <description>This course will provide fundamental knowledge in immunology as well as some advanced topics from cutting-edge research results, such as cancer immunotherapy and novel vaccine development.

Immunity is the body’s system of protection from attack by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the “enemies of human life” have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.

During this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications. We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.

The part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each. The first week covers introductory subjects and specific topics follow from the second week.</description>

                    <title>Introduction to Sociology</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-sociology-utpermianbasinx-soci101x-0</link>
                    <description>Very often we see, hear or experience things that seem "strange" and incomprehensible to us. We start to wonder about the world around us, asking questions like: “How do certain people become billionaires when others are homeless? Why do humans worship Gods or form families? What makes killing in war acceptable but not in any other situation?”

If you have ever wondered about these issues and/or other, you aren’t alone. Similar questions have been asked since the beginning of history, and searching for objective answers using scientific research is the goal of sociology. 

This course is designed to look critically and analytically through different sociological perspectives, including the functionalist, interactionist, conflict and feminist, to help us realize the extent to which society guides our thoughts and actions. The course material provides a fresh, new look at societies and cultures—more objective, full of inquiry and analysis, striving towards social justice and change. Sociology urges us to draw connections between public issues and personal problems, to see the strange as familiar and the familiar as strange, and to examine biography in a historical and social context.

Issues of inequalities, social class, race, sexual orientation, disability, age and gender are critically examined within a global perspective in this course. You do not need any prior knowledge of sociological theories or methods to take this class.  Bring your life experiences and knowledge, and see how the Sociological Imagination will allow you to dispel cultural myths and reframe reality.This course will cover topics found on the CLEP Sociology exam.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/nanotechnology-fundamentals-purduex-nano530x</link>
                    <description>The transistor has been called the greatest invention of the 20th century – it enables the electronics systems that have shaped the world we live in. Today’s nanotransistors are a high volume, high impact success of the nanotechnology revolution. If you are interested in understanding how this scientifically interesting and technologically important nano-device operates, this course is for you!

This nanotechnology course provides a simple, conceptual framework for understanding the essential physics of nanoscale transistors.  It assumes only a basic background in semiconductor physics and provides an opportunity to learn how some of the fascinating new discoveries about the flow of electrons at the nanoscale plays out in the context of a practical device.

The course is divided into four units:

Transistors fundamentals
	Transistor electrostatics
	Ballistic MOSFETs
	Transmission theory of the MOSFET
The first two units provide an introduction for students with no background in transistors or a quick review for those familiar with transistors.  The third unit treats the ballistic transistor in which electrons move without resistance (in the traditional sense). The last unit uses that Landauer Approach to electron transport, which was developed to understand some striking experiments in nanophysics, to develop an understanding of how electrons flow in modern nanotransistors.  This short course describes a way of understanding MOSFETs that is much more suitable than traditional approaches when the channel lengths are of nanoscale dimensions. Surprisingly, the final result looks much like the traditional, textbook, MOSFET model, but the parameters in the equations have simple, clear interpretations at the nanoscale.

My objective for this course is to provide students with an understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale transistors as well as some of the practical technological considerations and fundamental limits. The goal is to do this in a way that is broadly accessible to students with only a very basic knowledge of semiconductor physics and electronic circuits. The course is designed for anyone seeking a sound, physical, but simple understanding of how nanoscale transistors operate. The course should be useful for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students, as well as researchers and practicing engineers and scientists.

This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.</description>

                    <description>Nanoelectronic devices are an integral part of our life, including the billion-plus transistors in every smartphone, each of which has an active region that is only a few hundred atoms in length.

This nanotechnology course explains the fundamentals of nanoelectronics and mesoscopic physics.

Even with NO prior background in quantum mechanics, you should learn about cutting-edge developments and concepts that will prepare you for a future in nanotechnology and nanoelectronics.

Indeed we hope you will be excited to join the field and help invent the new devices that will shape the electronics of this century and meet its challenges.

Second in a two part series, this nanotechnology course provides an introduction to more advanced topics, including the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) method widely used to analyze quantum transport in nanoscale devices. We will explore a number of topics within nanoelectronics, taking a more in depth look at quantum transport, gaining greater insight into the application of the Schrodinger Equation, and learning the basics of spintronics.

“The course was just awesome!”

                    <description>The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.
 
In the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.
 
Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.
 
This course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.
 Sample comments:
From Roald Hoffmann, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Hoffmann
Cornell University "… the pedagogical imperative in research is very important to me, and so I really value a kindred spirit. Your (Datta's) online courses are just wonderful!"
 
From anonymous student in previous offering."The course was just awesome .. Prof. Datta's style of delivering lecture is mind-blowing."
 
This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.</description>

                    <title>Stand up for Science: Practical Approaches to Discussing Science that Matters</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/stand-science-practical-approaches-michiganx-teachout-3x</link>
                    <description>Everyone - non-scientists and scientists alike - has some form of expertise, but communicating across a gap in knowledge or experience is challenging. In this Teach-Out, we address this challenge by helping participants to develop core communication skills and more effectively communicate with one another.

Participants will learn why science communication is both essential and fundamentally challenging. Experts in three broad areas of public engagement with science - Policy &amp; Advocacy, Education &amp; Outreach, and Science in the Media - will weigh in to share their knowledge. Anyone with a STEM story to tell will have the opportunity to develop a better understanding of their audience, craft a clear message, weave a compelling story, and practice giving and receiving feedback on science communications. And all participants will be able to engage in a series of discussions addressing key issues in science communication.

Because the practice of science encourages dialogue, requires diverse perspectives, and has no political agenda, we hope this Teach-Out is a useful step in encouraging more science conversations between individuals and their local, national, and global communities.

                    <title>Introduction to Solar Systems Astronomy</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-solar-systems-astronomy-asux-ast111x-5</link>
                    <description>This course is part of Global Freshman Academy (GFA), which means you can earn transferable ASU credit toward your college degree.

In this introductory 4-credit hour lecture and laboratory course, we will explore the origins, structure, contents, and evolution of our solar system and exosolar planetary systems. We will cover the history of astronomy, properties of light, instruments, the study of the solar system and nearby stars.

Throughout the course, we will learn about the Discovery Channel Telescope, the Lowell Observatory, the Challenger Space Center, and Meteor Crater, the world’s best-preserved meteorite impact site on Earth. We will also get a chance to virtually walk through the Lunar Exploration Museum and Arizona State University’s Moeur Building, home of the Mars Space Flight Facility where ASU scientists and researchers are using spacecraft instruments on Mars to explore the geology and mineralogy of the red planet.

This course satisfies the Natural Science — Quantitative (SQ) general studies requirement at Arizona State University. Introduction to Astronomy may satisfy a general education requirement at other institutions; however, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.</description>

                    <description>This introductory course has the same rigor as the regular M.I.T. course of the same name, which is one of the first subjects in M.I.T.'s Mechanical Engineering undergraduate curriculum.

In this course, students will learn to analyze and predict the dynamic behavior of objects and systems, their motions and associated forces, and understand mechanical systems of complexity that are representative of engineering practice.  Students will also analyze the kinematics of mechanisms, understand torque and angular momentum in rigid bodies in rotation, and imbalance in rotating systems. Finally students will derive nonlinear equations of motion for a wide variety of mechanical systems, solve them using numerical methods in MATLAB as well as plot and interpret results.

The course combines a unique blend of rigor and realism to produce fundamental skills in an accessible, entertaining format.

Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.</description>

                    <description>This electronics course will focus on the physics of biomolecule detection in terms of three elementary concepts: response time, sensitivity, and selectivity. We will use potentiometric, amperometric, and cantilever-based mass sensors to illustrate the application of these concepts to specific sensor technologies. Learners in this course will be able to decide what sensors to make, appreciate their design principles, interpret measured results, and spot emerging research trends.

This electronics course is the latest in a science and engineering series offered by the nanoHUB-U project, which is jointly funded by Purdue University and the National Science Foundation. </description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/organic-electronic-devices-purduex-nano515x</link>
                    <description>Organic electronic devices are quickly making their way into the commercial world, with innovative thin mobile devices, high-resolution displays, and photovoltaic cells. The future holds even greater potential for this technology, with an entirely new generation of ultralow-cost, lightweight and even flexible electronic devices, which will perform functions traditionally accomplished with much more expensive components based on conventional semiconductor materials, such as silicon.

Learn more about this highly promising technology, which is based on small molecules and polymers, and how these materials can be implemented successfully in established (e.g., organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices) and emerging (e.g., thermoelectric (TE) generators) organic electronic modules.

In this course you will gain the ability to tie molecular transport phenomena with macroscopic device response such that you will be well-prepared to analyze, troubleshoot, and design the next generation of organic electronic materials and devices.
 
This course has short lectures with quizzes, homework, and exams.

This course is the latest nanoHUB-U project in a series offered is jointly funded by Purdue University and the NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines though short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. </description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/flight-vehicle-aerodynamics-mitx-16-110x-0</link>
                    <description>This course covers the physics, concepts, theories, and models underlying the discipline of aerodynamics. A general theme is the technique of velocity field representation and modeling via source and vorticity fields, and via their sheet, filament, or point-singularity idealizations.

The intent is to instill an intuitive feel for aerodynamic flowfield behavior, and to provide the basis of aerodynamic force analysis, drag decomposition, flow interference estimation, and many other important applications. A few computational methods are covered, primarily to give additional insight into flow behavior, and to identify the primary aerodynamic forces on maneuvering aircraft. A short overview of flight dynamics is also presented.

FAQ

Is there a required textbook?
You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online. This includes a full textbook in PDF form. If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided.

Can I still register after the start date?
You can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.

How are grades assigned?
Grades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice "Concept Questions " completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course.

How does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live?
Video lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.

Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes, transcripts of the course will be made available.

Will the material be made available to anyone registered for this course?
Yes, all the material will be made available to all students.

What are the prerequisites?
The student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.

Who can register for this course?
Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.</description>

                    <description>How can you distinguish between credible information and “fake news?” Reliable information is at the heart of what makes an effective democracy, yet many people find it harder to differentiate trustworthy journalism from propaganda. Increasingly, inaccurate information is shared on social networks and amplified by a growing number of explicitly partisan news outlets. This Teach-Out will examine the processes that generate both accurate and inaccurate news stories and the factors that lead people to believe those stories. Participants will gain skills help them to distinguish fact from fiction.</description>

                    <title>Top 10 Social Issues for the President’s First 100 Days</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/top-10-social-issues-presidents-first-pennx-top10x</link>
                    <description>Be part of the national conversation in the first 100 days of the new Presidential Administration and Congress.

On January 20, 2017, the United States will inaugurate Donald Trump as its 45th President and open a new Congress. For the next four years, he will work with Congress to pass new laws and to implement social policies that will impact all of us. The beginning of a new presidential administration is a crucial time to talk about issues that are of concern and impact our lives and community.

In this MOOC, you will tap into the knowledge and ideas of the renowned University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy &amp; Practice (SP2) faculty to examine the most pressing social justice and policy issues facing the United States. You will connect with fellow learners to collaborate on other issues that may be impacting your life, your community, or the nation as a whole. Together, we will create a list of priorities for the newly elected President and Congress.

Along the way, our faculty will continually update the materials and make sure you know, in real time, what is unfolding on the national level on the issues presented here. We will post pertinent articles and thoughtful commentaries.

The course is self-paced and will start on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2017) and run for the first 100 days (ending May 1). There is no straight path through the course; you will create your own learning plan. We offer our faculty and their research for your consideration and discussion, but it is you who has to decide to engage. This MOOC will only be successful with your participation, your voice and your critical thinking on how to make sense of—and transform! —our world.

Join us, be part of the national conversation.

Special Opportunity for Verified Certificate Learners: The first 300 verified learners will receive a copy of the recently published volume Social Policy and Social Justice featuring essays by course faculty and published in November 2016 by the University of Pennsylvania Press; there will be no additional cost beyond the fee for the verified certificate.</description>

                    <title>Framing: How Politicians Debate</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/framing-how-politicians-debate-delftx-frame101x-1</link>
                    <description>Is a good, solid argument enough to make an impact? How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.

In today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.

When you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home.

We invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself. 

This course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.

                    <description>As the US general election approaches, there is a firestorm of rhetoric around access and fraud. Major legislation changes, court rulings and political views continue to flood the media leading up to this election. But what is true in all of this? And what should you believe going into the election?

In this 2-week course, you’ll better understand the history of voting rights in the US, what is meant by the terms “access” and “fraud” – and why these have become so politicized.

Hear from political scientists who study these matters, journalists who have reported on it for decades and election officials who describe what its like to be in charge of carrying out free and fair elections in their jurisdiction.

Join a vibrant community of fellow voters who are interested in exploring these questions together. Share your experience and see how it compares to others around the country.

                    <description>Fake news is a real problem. From allegations of election fraud to Pizzagate, fake news saturates our newsfeeds-- and our national discourse. Some say it has compromised the authority of journalism, others say writing fake news stories has brought them a fistful of money. What do we make of this phenomenon? Why is fake news so prevalent these days? And how should we respond?

In this 2-week course, we’ll pose these questions (and more) to scholars, working journalists, and media pundits in order to get a hold on this complicated issue. Join a vibrant community of critical thinkers who are interested in exploring these questions together. Share your experience and see how it compares to others around the world.

This course is part of a broader series from Davidson College, called Davidson Now. We seek to explore critical issues and engage in honest and courageous conversations.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/solving-public-policy-problems-uc-uc-berkeleyx-policy01x-1</link>
                    <description>Interested in public policy thinking? This course will equip you to utilize a powerful, eight-step method for analyzing public policy problems and formulating recommendations for addressing them.

To help you learn the “eightfold path” to problem solving, you will review and enjoy lectures and presentations by faculty from UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy, the top-ranked graduate academy in this field. You will examine specific policy examples and learn to apply this method to the social challenges you wish to concentrate upon in your own  work.

And this course is just the beginning! Consider exploring graduate training in public policy. Earn a Masters in Public Affairs (MPA) degree from the Goldman School.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/applications-linear-algebra-part-1-davidsonx-d003x-1</link>
                    <description>From simulating complex phenomenon on supercomputers to storing the coordinates needed in modern 3D printing, data is a huge and growing part of our world. A major tool to manipulate and study this data is linear algebra. This course is part 1 of a 2-part course.  In this part, we’ll learn basics of matrix algebra with an emphasis on application. This class has a focus on computer graphics while also containing examples in data mining. We’ll learn to make an image transparent, fade from one image to another, and rotate a 3D wireframe model. We’ll also mine data; for example, we will find similar movies that one might enjoy seeing. In the topic of sports ranking, we’ll be ready to participate in March Madness and submit our own mathematically generated brackets to compete against millions of others. The lectures are developed to encourage you to explore and create your own ideas either through your own programming but also with online tools developed for the course. Come to this course ready to investigate your own ideas.

                    <description>Our world is in a data deluge with ever increasing sizes of datasets. Linear algebra is a tool to manage and analyze such data.

This course is part 2 of a 2-part course, with this part extending smoothly from the first. Note, however, that part 1, is not a prerequisite for part 2. In this part of the course, we'll develop the linear algebra more fully than part 1. This class has a focus on data mining with some applications of computer graphics. We'll discuss, in further depth than part 1, sports ranking and ways to rate teams from thousands of games. We’ll apply the methods to March Madness. We'll also learn methods behind web search, utilized by such companies as Google.  We'll also learn to cluster data to find similar groups and also how to compress images to lower the amount of storage used to store them. The tools that we learn can be applied to applications of your interest.  For instance, clustering data to find similar movies can be applied to find similar songs or friends. So, come to this course ready to investigate your own ideas.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-everyone-georgetownx-phyx-008-01x</link>
                    <description>Quantum Mechanics for Everyone is a four-week long MOOC that teaches the basic ideas of quantum mechanics with a method that requires no complicated math beyond taking square roots (and you can use a calculator for that). Quantum theory is taught without “dumbing down” any of the material, giving you the same version experts use in current research. We will cover the quantum mystery of the two-slit experiment and advanced topics that include how to see something without shining light on it (quantum seeing in the dark) and bunching effects of photons (Hong-Ou-Mandel effect).

To get a flavor for the course and see if it is right for you, watch "Let's get small", which shows you how poorly you were taught what an atom looks like, and "The fallacy of physics phobia." 

Please note: the four sections of this course will be released on a weekly basis from April 18, 2017 to May 9, 2017, when all the course material will be available and the course will become fully self-paced.

                    <description>Optimization is the search for the best and most effective solution. In this mathematics course, we will examine optimization through a Business Analytics lens. You will be introduced to the to the theory, algorithms, and applications of optimization. Linear and integer programming will be taught both algebraically and geometrically, and then applied to problems involving data. Students will develop an understanding of algebraic formulations, and use Julia/JuMP for computation. Theoretical components of the course are made approachable, and require no formal background in linear algebra or calculus.

The recommended audience for this course is undergraduates, as well as professionals interested in using optimization software. The content in this course has applications in logistics, marketing, project management, finance, statistics and machine learning.

Most of the course material will be covered in lecture and recitation videos, and only an optional textbook, available at no cost, will be used.

Students interested in the material prior to deciding on course enrollment can visit the MIT Open Courseware version of 15.053 Spring 2013. The topics of the 2013 subject were optimization modeling, algorithms, and theory. As a six week subject, 15.053x covers about half of the material of the 2013 subject. The primary focus of 15.053x is optimization modeling.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-human-evolution-wellesleyx-anth207x-1</link>
                    <description>As contemporary humans, we are a product of our evolutionary past. That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge.

The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</description>

                    <description>In the first half of this course, we'll investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does DNA replication begin? You will learn how to answer this question for many bacteria using straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.
In the second half of the course, we'll examine a different biological question, and ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks. The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA? Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA. Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms to solve problems.
Finally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go "dormant" within a host for many years before causing an active infection.
This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology.</description>
